# Logging standard

This project provides:

 * Regexes that document the logging standard, which is based on Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Sleuth.
 * Python code to parse and generate log messages in this standard format.

NB: this repo includes a copy of the B3 code in order to log tracing information.
